Next step: make test_camper_utils.py

I am thinking about how to store tables, groups, and campers so
I can easily access them and so I can keep track of which ones have
been used or not.

Right now I have tables_master, a dictionary which keeps track of
what tables exist (format: { '2' : <table-object>, 'Head' : <table-object> etc. })

I think that this concept could be useful for keeping master lists of campers
(master dict of campers by id) and groupings (master list of groupings by
table name & date? Or maybe a dict of dicts?)

It could also be useful for keeping track of campers/tables/groupings on
a day-by-day basis. You could have dicts like Monday-tables, Monday-campers,
etc. that only contain tables/campers/groupings (?) not yet assigned.
If you have to de-assign a camper/group b/c it's not optimal, you
put it back into that dict. All of the dicts always exist (maybe they're
stored in a master dict?) so you always have some sort of record of
state on that day. You might want to do more with that, though. I guess
that between those dicts and your output data structure you have a full
record of state at each point.
